As a full stack developer, I bring a wealth of experience and skills to the table, enabling me to design, develop, and deploy high-quality software applications from end to end. With proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, I possess a deep understanding of the entire technology stack, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more. I particularly specialize in work with the Microsoft tech-stack including C#, ASP.NET, .NET Core and Framework etc.

I have a proven track record of delivering innovative and efficient solutions that meet business needs while adhering to best practices and industry standards. My expertise extends to agile development methodologies, continuous integration and deployment, and testing frameworks.

I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies, and I am committed to ongoing professional development to maintain a cutting-edge skillset. With strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, I excel in both individual and team-oriented environments.
